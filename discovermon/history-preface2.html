In 1206 the warring nomadic tribes were unified by Chinggis Khan under a feudal state that covered the Central Asian plateau, Northern China, present-day Russia and part of Iran. In the 150 years that followed, Mongols built up one of the largest empires ever known. With the death of Chinggis Khan in 1227, the empire was divided into four empires ruled by his sons and grandsons. They extended the territory, conquering almost the whole Eurasian continent from Southeast Asia to Central Europe.</p><p>
By the mid-1300s the Mongolian Empire began to weaken due to internal quarrels and struggles for power among the princes. After several attempts to consolidate its parts, the empire collapsed. With the fall of the Yuan Empire established by Khubilai Khan, the grandson of Chinggis, Mongols began to withdraw to their homeland.
