<p>The Constitution legalised the tenet that "The Government is the highest executive body of the State". As the result of the State Great Khural's election the legal condition for the establishment of a new Government is created. The Government is accountable for its work to the State Great Khural and the term of its mandate is four years. The Government shall step down in its entirety upon the resignation of the Prime Minister or if half the members of the Government resign at the same time.</p>

<p>Carrying out the State laws and directing the economic, social and cultural development of the country, the Government exercises broad powers, determined by law.</p>

<p>The Government comprises the Prime Minister, the chief of Cabinet Secretariat and the ministers. The current Mongolian Government has 13 ministries. </p>
