      <p>The Mongolian Railway with a sixty year history of labor and work has made a real contribution in the economic development of Mongolia and has been playing a historic role in creating the national transport network connecting new industrialized regions, mineral deposits and large and small towns and urban places where population concentrates and in the economic development of the country.</p>
<p>The railway is the main line for landlocked Mongolia to get connected with the countries of Europe, East and South East Asia with transport relations through its two neighbor countries and the mainland bridge connecting the East and the West and an integrated part of the international railway network.</p>
<p>The railway has been conducting stable activity in the market of transport service and today it is working to build trans-shipment and freight service complex at the border station, increase the depot of vehicles, improve the railway, strengthen its capacity and introduce an automated system of transport management and accounting.</p>
<p>Let us express our special gratitude and respect to you who have been established business relations with the Mongolian Railway and are interested in cooperation with it.
