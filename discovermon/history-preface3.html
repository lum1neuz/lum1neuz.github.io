In 1636, the Manchuâ€™s (China's Qing Dynasty) extended its rule over the southern part of Mongolia, known as Inner Mongolia, and in 1691 four princedoms of Khalkh Mongolia were subjugated to the same rule.</p><p>
During Manchu rule, the Mongolian people did not give up their struggle for independence, but all Mongol uprisings and revolts were furiously suppressed. The period of Manchu rule is remembered as a degrading time in Mongolian history
When the Manchu Qing dynasty fell in 1911, Mongol princes declared independence. After the proclamation of independence, Chinese and Russian warlords made several attempts to gain control over Mongolia. In this critical period, a new government headed by the Mongolian People's Party came to power in 1921, with Russia's help.
