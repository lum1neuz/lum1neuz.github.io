      <p>MNCCI was established on 02 July 1960 under the name of "Chamber of Commerce" with a staff of the chairman, the foreign trade arbitrator and the general secretary. Until 1990, in coordination with socialist system of that period, the activities of the Chamber were very limited and it has been taking the role of promoting trade and industry as a quasi-governmental agency. When Mongolia has transited to market economy the opportunities lea the private sector to be promoted. In the course of 42 years of history the Chamber had been conducting its activities within the administration scope of the Ministries for 30 years and for the last 12 years it has been acting independently. 
The first meeting of member companies of the Chamber held in 1961 and admitted 29 organizations as its active members. Since the adoption of the Law of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 1995 the Chamber's activities have been expanding both domestically and internationally. Today the Chamber is the main business representative body of Mongolian business community engaging the most of companies, enterprises and trade organizations in its wide range of activities and services and protecting their common interests. </p>
