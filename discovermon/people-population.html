<p>
    The development of the present ethnic composition has gone through several historical stages. The formation and disintegration of numerous military tribal alliances of ancient nomads and their mass migration over vast expanses of the Euro-Asian steppes, resulted in the emergence of the Mongolian Nationality which consists 86% of Khalkh-Mongol tribes. The population of Mongolia consists of twenty ethnic groups although there are few differences in language. Only the Kazakhs speak in their mother tongue. Kazakhs, Derbets, Buryats and other national minorities are concentrated where they have always lived.<br>
  The results of 2010 Population and Housing Census revealed that in November 2010, population of Mongolia reached 2,754  thousand. However, even today, there are more Mongolians living outside Mongolia than in it.  The population density is around 1.7 people per square kilometre.<br>
     There are approximately 713,780 families of which 234,300 are herders. The others live in urban centres. 67.2% of the population is urbanised, over 43.6% in Ulaanbaatar. In the first 10 months of 2011, 58.6 thous. mothers delivered 58.9 thous. children (live birth), the amount is increased by 3423 mothers or 6.2 percent, and 3444 children or 6.2 percent, compared to the same period of previous year.
  In the first 10 months of 2011, the infant mortality per 1000 life births was 16.</p>
