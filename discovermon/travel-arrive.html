  A simple way of expedition-transportation to Mongolia for visitors is travel by Trans Siberian Railway, which stretches from Russian borders via Ulaanbaatar to the Chinese borders. Exploring Mongolia following the rail lines of the legendary Trans Mongolian and Trans Siberian Railways is more than a simple way of transportation, it is an expedition in itself. Total distance by rail from Beijing to St Petersburg is 7,925 km. Travelers can join in Moscow (or St Petersburg) or in Beijing (or Hong Kong and Hanoi). There are usually nine compartments in each carriage with four berths in each (Twin share rail compartments are available for a supplementary price). See for timetable at www.mtz.mn.
