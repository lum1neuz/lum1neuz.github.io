    <h1 class="textcenter">Coal Production</h1>

    <div class="col-12">
     <img class=" imgborder mediumpadding left imgspace" src="images/eco/coal.jpg">
<p>Mongolia has over 300 known coal deposits with an estimated 
152 billion tonnes of coal resources. Of these, detailed geological 
studies have been completed at about 80*. Companies with 
coking coal deposits attract the most attention, as their products 
are exported at considerable profits</p>

<p>Mongolian coal mines gradually shifted toward the modern 
industrial production methods between 1940 and 1970. 
However, formal resource estimations, tests for coking qualities 
and modern geological studies were not conducted until the 
late sixties. However, even at the turn of the twentieth century, 
Russian geologists had published their observation of some of 
the most famous deposits today, such as Tavan Tolgoi, EgiinGol 
and Choir. During the twentieth century, open-pit coal mines 
were created in almost every aimag so that Mongolia’s domestic 
demand for thermal coal was completely met.</p>
  <img class=" imgborder mediumpadding left" src="images/eco/coal2.jpg"><p>In 1993, the geologist D. Bat-Erdene and Tuya estimated 
that Mongolia has over 152 billion tonnes of coal resources. 
Since then, many private companies have entered the country, 
and many have completed the Australian JORC or Canadian NI 
43-101 compliant resource and/or reserve estimations. The total 
coal resource estimation is expected to rise according to most 
experts, as more detailed geological surveys are completed.
Mongolia’s coal production has been on the rise since the 
troubled 90’s, when nearly all enterprises, including coal mines, 
suffered due to the instability of the transitional economy. The 
total amount of coal mined in Mongolia began to grow rapidly 
after 2004, which is about the time the current resource boom 
and the export rush started. In 2011, the total production was at 
32 million tonnes, and over 66% were for export.</p>
<p>In the first seven months of 2012, Mongolia mined about 14.3 
million tonnes of coal, which is 7% less than the production in the 
same period in 2011. Many of the mining companies are reporting 
lower-than-expected coking coal prices and lower sales for the first 
half of 2012. This is mainly attributed to the Euro-zone related global 
economic slowdown, and the cooling of China’s steel production.</p>
<p>The domestic coal consumption had stayed more or less 
constant, between 5-6 million tonnes per annum, between 1991 and 
2008. In 2009, when the domestic consumption reached 7 million 
tonnes, it had finally reached the recorded level in 1990. Since then, 
the domestic total consumption grew to 11 million tonnes in 2011. 
During this period of growth in domestic consumption, Mongolia 
experienced a pick-up in industrial output as well, although high 
GDP growth rates had started much earlier, driven by the coal 
mining industry’s contribution.</p>

<h2>Production Outlook</h2>
  <img class=" imgborder mediumpadding left" src="images/eco/coal3.jpg"><p>The future production decisions of Mongolian firms depend 
heavily on where China’s economy is headed. China’s steel 
production, which is practically the sole end use of Mongolian 
coking coal, may pick up steam or cool off depending on China’s 
policy and other uncertain things. During the 2008 recession, China 
was able to sail through by boosting its domestic expenditure on 
fixed investments. Bridges, dams, buildings, roads and high-speed 
train tracks were built across the nation to inject cash into the 
economy, hence fill the gap left by the vanishing demands for its 
manufacturing goods exports. </p>
<p>The quagmire slowdown that began in mid-2011 as a result 
of the Euro-zone debt crisis has yet to see any relief or realistic 
route of escape, and the softness or hardness of China’s “landing” 
is a hot debate topic today. Whether China’s leaders will continue 
to boost fixed investments, which in-turn boost steel usage, is 
currently unclear. The other two pillars of China’s economy are 
domestic consumption and exports. While export is clearly suffering, 
domestic consumption is slowly but steadily rising. The question is 
whether consumption rises fast enough to replace the hole left by 
the falling exports and fixed investments. If no, heavy investments 
in more infrastructure and construction my yet be necessary to 
avoid a hard landing. Even if consumption rises quickly, there are 
other questions that must be answered, such as the source and 
route of financing of the infrastructure projects. </p>
<p>All in all, it is not likely for the coking coal consumption in 
China to rise significantly in the near future. However, despite 
the reduction in GDP growth target, China’s goal of a 7.5% 
growth is still a very high number. Therefore, we believe 
demand is certainly enough to sustain the current production 
level. In particular, as Mongolian coal prices are much lower 
than seaborne coal, the trend may even benefit the Mongolian 
producers for a period at the expense of Australian coal 
producers.</p>
  <img class=" imgborder mediumpadding left" src="images/eco/coal4.jpg"><p>The other limiting factor to production in Mongolia is internal. 
Currently, the existing rail, paved and dirt roads are all struggling 
to meet the export demand. The processing centres at border 
checkpoints are operating all but at capacity. According to the 
president of the Association of Mongolian Industrial Geologists 
D. Bat-Erdene, if coal transport roads can be improved 
sufficiently, Mongolia can easily increase the current production 
level of about 30 million tonnes per annum by 10–15% . 
Therefore, even if China’s demand for coking coal continues to 
rise, infrastructure within Mongolia can be a limiting factor.
The production of thermal coal depends on the demand 
for electricity in Mongolia, as the relatively cheap price for this 
product does not justify exports. As the electricity consumption 
driven by industrial production increases, as planned by the 
government, more power plants will have to be constructed. The 
grids in Mongolia have a total ready capacity of 890 megawatts 
today. The tentative plans for new power stations would add 527 
megawatts to this capacity by 20157.</p>
