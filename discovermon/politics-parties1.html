        Before 2008, Mongolia had a winner-takes-all voting system, which meant that there could be large differences in the composition of the parliament between elections, and that strict party discipline was not encouraged. In the 2008 parliamentary elections, a block voting system was used. In the 2012 elections, 48 seats were chosen at the local level, and 28 were chosen proportionally by party. Elections results were delayed due to a controversy over accuracy of the results. In the 2016 elections, after a new change of the electoral law, the then-governing Democratic Party lost to a landslide victory of the Mongolian People's Party.
