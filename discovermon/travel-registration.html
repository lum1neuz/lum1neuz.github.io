        Registration Information for Visitors</h1> 
        <div class="smallspace"></div>
    <div class="row">

    <p> These guidelines have been produced to assist visitors to Mongolia with information about registering with the  Office of Immigration, Naturalization and Foreign Citiizens upon arrival.</p> 

<H2>Who should register?</H2> 
 <p> All visitors spending more than 30 days in Mongolia must register with the Office  of Immigration, Naturalization and Foreign Citizens unless they are on an official visit. 
Those people visiting Mongolia for 30 days or less are deemed as registered when they pass through immigration and therefore have no action to take as long as they do not stay longer in the country. 
  Visitors with a visa for more than 30 days or just an entry visa must register within 10 days of arrival in Mongolia. 
  Those people, who enter on a visa for less than 30 days but wish to stay longer than 30 days, must register themselves between the 30th and 40th day of being in the country. </p> 

<H2>How do I register? </H2> 
<p>The process of registration depends on the purpose of stay in Mongolia.
Work — submit passport and official letter from employer 
Tourist — submit passport and official letter from tour operator / company 
Independent — submit passport, passport photo, required fee, and fill in application form. 

  A visitor's first registration must be made at the State Centre in Ulaanbaatar. In the future it may be possible to obtain subsequent registrations at the police departments in Sum and Aimag centres. </p> 

<h2>Going to be in the countryside? </h2>
  <p>Visitors who will be living or staying outside of the capital, Ulaanbaatar, for more than 7 days in one place, must obtain supplementary permission before departing. The required permission letter is also available from the State Centre, free of charge. When a visitor then goes to the countryside, they must register with the Aimag and Sum police departments on entry and exit from that location. Visitors who intend to visit many countryside locations, each for more than 7 days, can obtain a permission letter that can be used for all Aimags. Registration should still take place upon commencement and end of the stay by obtaining police stamps. Occasional visits to Ulaanbaatar by people registered in the countryside do not require informing the local police department. </p>

<h2>How much does registration cost? </h2>
  <p>Police registrations are valid for as long as the visitor's visa is valid, up to a maximum of one year. The initial charge is MNT 25,000 and renewal charge MNT 12,000 for one-year registration. Tourist registrations are around 5,000 T for a 30-day period.  Failure to register with the police will result in a fine of between MNT 30,000 and MNT 60,000, and MNT 2,000 per day unregistered. </p>

<h2>Notes </h2>
  <p>If a passport expires during a visitor's stay, then a new registration must be applied for. Visitors to Mongolia should carry their passport with them at all times. Photocopies of passports are not officially deemed sufficient although some police departments will accept them. An alternative to a passport  for identification purposes is an official ID card issued by an employer (written in Mongolian). If stopped by a police officer, they should show you identification and then explain why they have stopped you. All police officers should have card identification with them. Complaints against the police can be made to the Chairman of Police at the nearest police department. If a response is unsatisfactory, a visitor can involve the courts. If a foreign visitor is arrested and taken to a police station, the visitor is entitled to make a telephone call. The police must, through the Ministry of External Relations, contact the visitor's representative Embassy within 24 hours of the arrest. </p>
