        <h2 class="textcenter uppercase">Administration system of Mongolia</h2>
        <p>
  &emsp;Mongolia is divided into 22 major administrative units comprising of 21 aimags and the capital city of Ulaanbaatar. All are governed by 'Khurals', or elected bodies. Aimag populations range between 12,500 and 122,000 people. They also vary in size with the largest covering as much as 165.4 square kilometres of territory. An aimag consists of up to 27 'soums', including the aimag centre. Soums in turn are comprised of 'baghs'. In Mongolia there are 331 soums and 1550 baghs. Also the capital city, Ulaanbaatar, is subdivided into 121 districts called 'khoroos'. In the country, the aimag centre is the administrative seat of local government, and the home of the aimag's legal bodies, theatres, hospitals, businesses, schools and industry. Most of the aimag population work in light industry, services and small business enterprises. Bagh populations tend to work in agricultural and animal husbandry. Baghs residents mainly lead a nomadic life. They migrate with their herds depending on the change in season and weather conditions. Typically their seasonal camps are located within the borders of their soum and baghs, though droughts, dzuds, and other I natural disasters, can push them to different areas.

<h2>Local self-government</h2><p>
The Constitution of Mongolia proclaimed that "Governance of administrative and territorial units Mongolia shall be organised on the  basis of a combination of the principles of both self-government and central Government".
Local governance is a combination of central governance and self-governance which are two types of social governance.
The self government means that citizens of Mongolia can decide directly and indirectly all matters concerning their life through respective or representative bodies taking account of the State interest, local specificities and financial resources. In spite of this, they must decide the matters themselves independently in conformity with the Constitution, the Law on Governance of Administrative and Territorial Units and other related legislation of Mongolia.</p>

<h2>System of Local self-governing bodies:</h2><p>
 In Aimags, the capital city, Soums and Duuregs there shall be Khurals (Assemblies) of representatives of the citizens of respective territories;
 In Baghs and Khoroos - general meetings of citizens.
Khurals of Aimags, the capital city, Soums and Duuregs enjoy considering and deciding all problems, which do not depend on higher stage of Khurals or other organizations, in its territory.
The main form of local self-government is the Khural. In between the sessions of the Khural and general meetings the presidiums shall assume administrative functions. The memberships of the Khurals as well as those of aimags, the capital city, soums and duuregs, baghs and Khoroos are different. For example: In aimags and the capital city Khurals' Presidium of Representatives of Citizens is composed of 5-9 members, whereas, in soums and duuregs 5-7 and in baghs and horoos 3-5 members, including the chairman and secretary respectively.
Regular meeting of the Khurals of Aimags, the capital city, Soums and Duuregs shall be convened once every year and of the Khurals of Baghs and Khoroos shall be convened less than twice every year.</p>
