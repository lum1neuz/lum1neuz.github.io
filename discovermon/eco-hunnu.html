    <p>Dear Passengers,</p>

<p>The foundations of Mongolian civil aviation has been set up in 1956 with the very first passenger flight service carried out by the legendary AN-2 aircraft, also known as the “Green Grasshopper” amongst the public. The AN-2 company that once reached every corner of the country by carrying many thousands of passengers has diverged from the Mongolian civil aviation (MIAT) entity in 1992 and has been providing dedicated agricultural flight services. A new page in the company’s history is being unveiled through new establishment to develop its services in the civil aviation industry.</p>

<p>We have purchased two, 50-seater Fokker-50 type aircrafts that are manufactured in Netherlands for our domestic flight routes to meet the growing market demand and economic growth of Mongolia. Additionally, we are in the process of acquiring Airbus Industry manufactured A319 aircrafts with the highest number of orders worldwide, which are globally acclaimed for its safety, comfort, convenience and economic efficiency.</p>

 

<p>It is our mission to connect domestic flight services of Mongolia to the global aviation network and introduce latest information technology innovations to provide full services that will equal the global standards and thus, we have invested greatly on this field. To accomplish this mission, we have submitted our membership application to the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and thus far we have received the two character designator and three numeric accounting prefix codes from IATA by making us the second airline to receive such codes. Henceforth, we are planning to undertake the IATA operational safety audit (IOSA) for global recognition of our company.</p>

<p>Wish you a pleasant journey.</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>CEO<br>
<b>Bayar.B</b></p>
