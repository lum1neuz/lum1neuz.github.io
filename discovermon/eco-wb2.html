<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Since 1991, IDA has supported rural development, education, improving the livability of Ulaanbaatar, ensuring sound management within the mining sector, sustainable infrastructure development in southern Mongolia, environmental protection, policy development and air pollution abatement measures.</p>
<p><b>The overall goal of the rural program</b> has been to reduce the vulnerability of herders to pastoral risk as well as to protect and extend gains made to provide relief in cases of climate emergencies, micro-finance, telecommunications and social services to rural residents.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The new livestock insurance regime is being scaled up nation-wide to protect herders from the vulnerability of natural and environmental risks. This project also improves the country’s risk management system. During 2006-2009, 15,802 herders were covered by the&nbsp;
Index Based Livestock Insurance Program (IBLIP) in four pilot <i>aimags</i> (provinces) Bayankhongor, Uvs, Sukhbaaatar and Khenty. 3947 herders have received indemnity payments of approximately 770 million Togrog through the program.</p>
<p>39,389 microfinance loans have been disbursed by banks and non-bank financial institutions, benefiting 181,470 people directly or indirectly under the microfinance fund which is a component of Mongolia’s >Sustainable Livelihoods Project (SLP). The SLP is supported by the World Bank and donor partners (European Union and the Japanese Government).</p>
<p>The SLP is also helping more than 127,287<b> </b>herder families improve their pastoral management skills.</p>
<p><b>In the energy sector</b>, the amount of overall system losses for electricity distribution companies continues to decline. The World Bank’s Energy Project has reduced technical and non-technical losses from an average of 31 percent to 22.7 percent in Ulaanbaatar (UB), and from 33.7 percent to 15 percent in six <i>aimag </i>centers. Overall system losses have been reduced to 25 percent, revenue collection ratio at <i>aimag </i>utilities has been increased to 94.5 percent while the targets are 20 percent and 90 percent respectively.</p>
<p><b>In the Information and Communications Technology sector</b>, there has been a significant increase in the coverage and use of relevant ICT services among the rural population through an incentive program supported by the Bank’s Information and Communications Infrastructure Development Project</a>&nbsp;. All <i>soum</i> (district) centers in Mongolia now have access to modern mobile telephony services and several rural <i>soums</i> centers have also access to Internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>In urban development</b>, Bank programs support the construction of water systems within <i>ger (nomadic tents)</i> areas. By constructing new water kiosks, the number of persons per water kiosk has decreased to 892 from 1492 per kiosk.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>In the education sector</b>, the basic education system has benefited from support provided under several Bank grant funds. The Global Education for All - Fast Track Initiativehas (i) upgraded education quality at all levels of schooling; (ii) provided education services that can be accessed by children in all parts of the country, including rural areas, and by poor and vulnerable groups; and (iii) improved the management capacity of central and local educational institutions at all levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fast track initiative project has provided rural schools with lab tops, projectors and mobile teaching stations to increase skills and knowledge of teachers and also make learning more interactive.</p>
<p>The Community Initiative Funds under the SLP is also assisting in the development of the education sector. Within this project, the renovation of rural schools’ ceilings, doors, windows and heating systems have been funded, as well as to the renovation of school dormitories which allow more rural children from nomadic families to go to school full time.</p>
<p>Under the&nbsp;Rural Education and Development Project&nbsp;(2006-2013):</p>
<ul>
<li><i>3,560 classrooms in 383 schools in all 21 provinces of Mongolia received 160 books each</i></li>
<li><i>4,549 teachers have been trained in READ methods</i></li>
<li><i>130,000 children have used these classroom libraries</i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>In economic management and governance</b>, the efficiency and effectiveness of governance processes in the management of public finances have been significantly improved by establishing Treasury management system and connection of GFMIS to all <i>aimags</i> and UB districts. &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>In the financial sector,</b> the focus has been on establishing and implementing a new risk management framework in participating banks. This ensures safe and efficient online transactions between end-users and their banks, improves access to new sectors/markets/business activities and increases term lending to support the private sector entities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
