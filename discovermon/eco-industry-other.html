<h2 class="textcenter" class="textcenter">SILVER</h2> <p>Four independent silver deposits were determined in Mongolia, and exploration works were carried out in the deposits. The main source of silver, reflected in the state reserves statistics, is silver-bearing, non-ferrous metal deposits. Most part of the silver reserve in the state reserve registration is allotted to the Asgat silver-sulfate, the Tuv and Mungun-Undur silver-mixed metal deposits. The silver reserve will be increased during exploration works of soil and mixed-metal deposits.</p>
<h2 class="textcenter" class="textcenter">LEAD AND ZINC</h2><p> Researched lead and zinc deposits are situated in the country's eastern part. The main lead and zinc deposits are the Tumurt Ovoo, Ulaantsav, Mungun-Undur and Baits. For infrastructure, those deposits are in the relatively possible zone but the deposits have not been exploited yet.
</p><h2 class="textcenter">TIN</h2><p> The Janchivlan, Modot and Elstei tin placers were researched and the Nukhet Mountain pass ore deposit was determined as being rich in tin.
</p><h2 class="textcenter" class="textcenter">TUNGSTEN</h2><p>The tungsten deposits and findings are widely dispersed in the territory of Mongolia. Currently, the Khovd Gol and Ulaan Uul tungsten deposits are being exploited.
</p><h2 class="textcenter" class="textcenter">IRON</h2><p> Exploration works were made in the Bayangol, Tumurtei and Tumur Tolgoi iron deposits and the deposits reserves were determined. These deposits are sufficient to provide the country's iron manufacture with raw materials. But the issue of discovering new iron deposits with high quality and large-scale reserves has still not been solved.
</p><h2 class="textcenter" class="textcenter">URANIUM</h2><p> Mongolia's uranium geological survey was conducted effectively. Currently, the uranium reserves are found in Gurvanbulag, Nemer and Mardai deposits of Dornod aimag. The uranium reserve in the deposit is 49.000 tons. It is observed that the uranium reserve of Gobi region will approximately reach 1.5 million tons. Among the sectors, which exploit resources, mineral and raw materials of the Gobi region fuel, energy, ore mines and construction material production are being better developed 98 percent of Mongolian energy production is produced by coal and ore mine's production occupies about 60 percent of the country's total export output.
</p><h2 class="textcenter">FLUORITE</h2><p> A total of 597,1 thousand tons of spar is extracted annually by Bor Undur mining under the joint Mongolian and Russian Monrostsvetmet Company. In addition, spar is also extracted in Berkh, Khar Airag, Urgun and Khajuu Ulaan mines.
