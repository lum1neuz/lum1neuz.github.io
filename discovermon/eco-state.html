      <p style="text-align:justify">Warm greetings to all our esteemed customers!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In 2015, the macro economic environment in
Mongolia faced challenges with economic growth at only 2.3%. While external and internal conditions were not favorable, State Bank was able to maintain its
sound operation thanks to the right policy and smart management approach, and led the banking sector invarious indicators.<br>
Currently, State Bank holds MNT 1.7 trillion in assets
and maintains all the prudential ratios such as capital
adequacy ratio and liquidity ratio established by the Bank
of Mongolia on a regular basis. Setting small and medium
enterprises and retail banking service as our target,
the Bank is expanding to have a nationwide network
that serves every corner of the country. Our customers
can receive all types of electronic banking services at
their convenience using the internet, mobile phone or
extensive network of ATMs located at our branches and

a bank with the best service, best communication and
profitability by maintaining its unique characteristics
in the banking and financial sector of Mongolia and
delivering the finest banking services and advocating all

due to the current economic and financial conditions,
