<p>Mongolia depended almost exclusively on livestock herding until the 1960s. From 1960 to 1980, Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon) aid to Mongolia focused on the Industrial sector. This had some success, and industrial production caught up with and then overtook agricultural output in the 1970s. By 1990, industry (excluding construction) accounted for 35.6% of GDP compared to 28.9% in 1980. The industrial sector employed 91 thousand people and produced MNT582.3 billion worth of products in 2000. The value of this sector is 23.2% of total GDP.
