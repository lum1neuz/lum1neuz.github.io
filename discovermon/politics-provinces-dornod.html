         The Dornod aimag borders on the North with the Russian Federation and on the East and South-East with the People's Republic of China. The Khalkh population dominate, but Buriad and Barga inhabit Ereentsav of Bayan Uul, Bayandun, Dashbalbar, Tsagaan-Ovoo somons. Uzemchid inhabit Gurvanzagal, Khuluunbuir somons.

There are 150-200 km wide steppes along both sides of Kherulen river. The lowest point of our country is the basin of Khukh lake/560m/ on the North-Eastern part of the Dornod aimag. There are the branches of Khyangan mountain range at 1000-1600 m above sea level on the east-southern part of the territory.
