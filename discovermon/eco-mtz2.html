      <p>A proposal on developing mining and building railway included in the letter given by VIII Bogd Javzandamba Khutagt, the Emperor of Mongolia, to the Ministers and officials of the State Upper Khural at the beginning of this century or in 4th year of Ascending the Throne (1915) was realized in 1938 when narrow gauge railway was opened between Ulaanbaatar and Nalaikh.</p>
<p>The Mongolian Railway, that was 43 km long and transported only more than one hundred thousand tons of freight each year, is 1815 km long today, carries out 96% of the national total freight service and 55% of passenger service and has taken a special place in the infrastructure sector of Mongolia.</p>
<p>Nowadays 13 thousand people work in the railway, 60% of them work in the basic transport industry and others work in more than 20 large organizations, such as trade, energy, water supply, repair of heavy machinery and equipment, timber processing plant, education, health protection and housing, that are intended to provide normal railway transportation.</p>
<p>The Mongolian Railway has been maintaining business relations with transport, trade and brokering organizations from about 60 countries of the world.</p>
