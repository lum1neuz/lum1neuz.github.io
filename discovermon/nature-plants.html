 Mongolia's diverse and distinctive vegetation includes an important part of Asia's plant life. Species representative of Siberia's coniferous taiga forest, Central Asia's steppe and desert, and the Altai and Sayan mountains all occur here. Steppe plants from Kazakhstan grow beside Manchurian steppe flowers. Over 100 plant species are listed in the Mongolian Red Book as rare or endangered.</p>
 <h2>Flora and Plant Resource of Mongolia</h2>
<p>According to study work of Mongolian flora, our scientists have established 2823 species of high vascular plants in 662 general  of 128 families and 920 species of lichen, 417 species of moss, 520 species of fungus, and 728 species of algae. And we have a herbarium which has more than a 100 of thou-sands of a collection, which is registered with the world foundation of herbarium.<br>
The largest families of flowering plants in Mongolia are-Asteraceae (407 species), Fabaceae (312), Poaceae (250), Rosaceae (140), Brassiceae (135), Cyperaceae (127), Ranunculaceae (119), Chenopodiaceae (90), Lamiaceae (86), Caryophyllaceae (83), Scrophulariaceae (77), Polygonaceae (67), Apiaceae (66), Salicaceae (50), Liliaceae (49). The largest genera of the flora of the country are-Astragalus (11 species), Artemisia (105), Oxytropis (94), Carex (86), Potentilla (61), Saussurea (49), Afflum (48), Salix (44), Taraxacum (37),<br>
A vegetation map of Mongolia with a scale of 1 - 1 500000, vegetation and hay-field map with a scale of 1:1000000, Mongolian vegetation and forest map with a scale of 1-1500000 and Mongolian ecosystems' map with a scale of 1 -1000000 have been made. As a result of research work to defend a theses 6 researcher published series of monograph "The Vegetation and Flora of Mongolia", "Forests of Mongolia", "Ecosystems of Mongolia", "Genera of the Oxytropis", "Genera of Caragana"', maps of Mongolia with more than a hundreds scientific articles.<br>
The results of our detachment activities showed that plants containing flavonolds-238 species, alkaloid bearing plants -280 species, coumarine bearing plants -more than 65, essential oil and a high vitamin stuff plants 200, medicinal plants -200 species, technical plants ornamental plants-more than 480 species, sand strengthening plants 70 species, sapone bearing plants-232 species, tanning plants-280 species, food plants-200 species, ornamental plants-more than 480 species, soil protecting and sand strengthening plants-70 species. 438 species of an-thropological plants included in 212 genera of families are spread in Mongolia.<br>
The 84.2 percent of these are endemic, 15.8 percent are originally from foreign plants. And also 545 species in 190 genera, 53 families of honey pollen plants were revealed and their yield and resources were established. From Mongolian flora, 975 species are registered as medicinal plants which are used in folk and traditional medicine of Mongolia and boundary countries, including 200 species which are used in modern medicine.<br> According to information of Ministry of Environment, more than 100 species are used in medicine; about 200 denominations of drugs are produced of 25 tons of drugs and perfumery goods. Mongolian scientists newly created 15 new remedies resulting from their chemical, pharmaceutical, pharmacological and clinical investigations.<br>
The result of these investigations led to a thesis for a degree on the following topics-The biology-ecological peculiarities of saxaul forests and their significance; the biology-ecological peculiarities of Thermoses and their significance; the bioecology, resources, life cycle Adonis mongolica Sims. Ways for it's introduction; The bio-morphology, ecology of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fish. And it's introduction, acclimatization and it's agrotechnics;<br>
In Ulaanbaatar researchers of Botanical garden have establishec the possibility of the acclimatization and introduction of 299 species of 125 genera, 25 families of plants in Mongolian natural conditions.
